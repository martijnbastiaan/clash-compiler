clash for Debian
---------------

Clash is a functional hardware description language that borrows both its 
syntax and semantics from the functional programming language Haskell. The 
Clash compiler transforms these high-level descriptions to low-level 
synthesizable VHDL, Verilog, or SystemVerilog.
